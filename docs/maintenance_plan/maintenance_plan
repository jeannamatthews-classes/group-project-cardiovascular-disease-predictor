Moving forward, this software will be maintained by Mariama Njie as an independent study. The initial efforts at further improvement will focus on developing a Machine Learning model with increased accuracy, reaching towards the goal of 90% accuracy. This will be obtained through either continuing to tune the parameters of the models applied to the existing data set, or through exploration of a new data set containing more fields. Once this objective is reached, the functionality of the application will be expanded. The first improvement will be having the application report the degree certainty of the predictions, in order to better guide clinical decisions. The user homepage will be expanded, allowing the clinician to create profiles for patients, load results from previous samples, and otherwise be able to determine the trajectory of the patient's health. There are additional plans to update the user interface for a more modern and user-friendly experience.
