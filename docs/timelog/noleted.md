Before Spring Break:
Before spring break, I spent approximately six hours researching the key risk factors of cardiovascular disease and searching for the ideal database for our project.

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-80919-9#Sec24

From these, I established an initial list of risk factors for CVD, HTN, and CAD:
--> CVD: Radiation exposure, age, ambient noise, irregular work hours, body weight and BMI, elevated triglyceride, history of HTN and CVD, elevated FBS levels, poor sitting posture, dust exposure, and smoking.
--> HTN: Continuous work shifts, BMI, body weight, family history of HTN, age, improper posture, elevated cholesterol levels, low HDL levels, gas exposure, prolonged sitting, smoking, dust exposure, and a history of HTN.
--> CAD: Smoking, Diabetes Mellitus, High Density Lipoprotein, Duke Treadmill Score, and Duration Recovery (from Duke Treadmill test)

Final Database Link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishsahani/hospital-admissions-data/data
This database contains information collected from patients admitted to the Hero DMC Heart Institute, such as their age, sex, patient history, smoking status, alcohol use, hemoglobin, total lymphocyte count, platelets, glucose, urea, creatinine, brain natriuretic peptide, raised cardiac enzymes, and ejection fraction. 

This database was selected because it covers a wide array of risk factors and discusses multiple cardiovascular diseases. This makes it ideal for the Plan A+ version of our project, which can report the patient's risk for specific cardiovascular diseases.

Meetings:
I have meet with Mariama to discuss the project every Tuesday and Saturday at 6:00PM to 6:30PM or 7:00PM. During these meetings, I presented my database research findings. In later meetings, Mariama has outlined the plan to analyze the data and has walked me through the code she has written in Jupyter.

Week of 3/24/25:
Monday: Spent 7 Hours (actually) watching Intro to HTML and Intro to CSS Tutorials and taking notes.

Wednesday: Spent 6.5 Hours watching Intro to JavaScript and taking notes.
Thursday: Spent 3.5 Hours watching Intro to JavaScript and taking notes.
Friday: Spent 1.25 Hours watching Into to JavaScript and taking notes.

Also on Friday: 0.5 Hours setting up Visual Studio Code and Linking Project Files
                1.5 Hours Intial GUI Coding
                
I now have a workspace in Visual Studio Code. I have installed the Live Server extension and can easily view the changes to my web GUI in real-time. I am following along with the web GUI outline provided in our design documents. Currently, I have created a home page containing a 'Login' button, which re-directs to a 'Login' page when clicked. This page has an in-progress form where the user can enter their username and password.
                
/* This week represented an above-average time-sink. I really wanted to learn JavaScript and
*  invested a LOT of time into it. All of the values above are genuinely accurate. I watched
*  a 1-hour HTML tutorial, a 4-hour CSS tutorial, and a 12-hour JavaScript tutorial in full.
